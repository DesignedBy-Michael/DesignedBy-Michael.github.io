        <h3>Key Ingredients for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>

        <p>
            The cookie dough is made from your standard cookie ingredients: flour,
            leavener, salt, sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla. Itâ€™s the <i>ratios</i> and 
            <i>temperature</i> of those ingredients that make this recipe stand out 
            from the rest.
